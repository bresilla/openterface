# Openterface CLI - Feature Implementation Status

## Overview

This is a CLI implementation of the Openterface Mini-KVM project, designed to provide a lightweight, cross-platform alternative to the Qt-based GUI version. The implementation focuses on core KVM functionality while removing Qt dependencies and providing a command-line first interface.

## Architecture

**Language**: C++20  
**Build System**: CMake  
**Primary Dependencies**: CLI11, Wayland (Linux)  
**Target Platform**: Linux (with V4L2 and Wayland support)

### Core Modules

- **KVM Manager** (`kvm.hpp/cpp`) - Central coordination and device management
- **Serial Module** (`serial.hpp/cpp`) - CH9329 chip communication via USB-to-serial
- **Video Module** (`video.hpp/cpp`) - V4L2-based video capture from MS2109 chip
- **Input Module** (`input.hpp/cpp`) - Wayland input capture and forwarding
- **GUI Module** (`gui.hpp/cpp`) - Native Wayland display interface
- **CLI Module** (`cli.hpp/cpp`) - Command-line interface using CLI11

## Command-Line Interface

### Current Commands
```bash
# Connect to Openterface device with auto-detection
./openterface-cli connect

# Verbose mode for debugging
./openterface-cli connect --verbose

# GUI-only mode (no serial control)
./openterface-cli connect --dummy
```

### Planned Commands (Not Implemented)
- Configuration management
- Script execution
- Firmware updates
- Audio control
- Recording/screenshot capture

## Build and Development

### Building the Project
```bash
# Configure build
cmake -B build

# Build all targets
cmake --build build

# Run main example
./build/examples/openterface-cli connect
```

### Development Tools
```bash
# Use Makefile wrapper for common tasks
make build      # Build project
make clean      # Clean build directory
make install    # Install built binaries
```

## Testing with Real Hardware

When testing with actual Openterface hardware:

1. **Video Connection**: Ensure MS2109 video capture device is detected by V4L2
2. **Serial Connection**: Verify CH9329 chip is accessible via USB-to-serial
3. **Permissions**: Set up proper udev rules for device access
4. **Dependencies**: Install required Wayland development libraries

### Required System Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt install build-essential cmake
sudo apt install libwayland-dev wayland-protocols
sudo apt install v4l-utils  # For video device testing

# Check video devices
v4l2-ctl --list-devices

# Check USB serial devices
ls /dev/ttyUSB* /dev/ttyACM*
```

## Migration Path from Qt Version

This CLI implementation provides a foundation for gradually porting features from the Qt version:

**Priority 1 (Core KVM)**:
- ‚úÖ Video display and capture
- ‚úÖ Keyboard/mouse input forwarding
- ‚úÖ Basic device management

**Priority 2 (Essential Features)**:
- ‚ùå Audio capture and forwarding
- ‚ùå Advanced video features (recording, screenshots)
- ‚ùå Configuration management

**Priority 3 (Advanced Features)**:
- ‚ùå Scripting system
- ‚ùå Network control
- ‚ùå Firmware management
- ‚ùå Multi-platform support

## Contributing

The codebase is structured for easy contribution:
- Each module is self-contained with clear interfaces
- CMake build system supports incremental development
- Modern C++ practices with smart pointers and RAII
- Documentation generation support for API reference

For hardware testing, the modular design allows testing individual components (video, serial, input) independently before integration.
